There is a site for installation of the Tesseract OCR 
https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html#macos

and it provides how to get the project and install the Tesseract.
However, in Mac OS, it is not required to compile it by yourself.

```
brew install tesseract
```

That is it!
Prerequisite will be installed before installing the tesseract.
How smart it is..
